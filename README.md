# 25YearsofChange
Using pandas, numpy, seaboard and matplotlib I aimed to study the relationship between mental health, religion and population. 

 I obtained datasets for each of these topics from three different sources as well as a dataset for the region classifications for each Country in the world. 

I standardized the data and assigned regions for each dataset and aggregated data for each region using the region classification dataset. My goal was to use datasets that had different ways of classifying regions/locations/countries and  I was then able to visualize the data and come to an conclusion. 

I was always under the impression that a population increase would inevitably lead to a decrease in subscription to religion and an increase in mental health issues and therefore an increase in suicide. On the contrary the relationship between these three are proportional and have remained relatively stable throughout the years. 

The supposed percieved increase can be attributed to the rise of social media and the fact that opinions and events are publicized on these platforms now more than ever before.
