# 25YearsofChange
Using pandas, numpy, seaboard and matplotlib I aimed to study the relationship between mental health, religion and population. 

 I obtained datasets for each of these topics from three different sources as well as a dataset for the region classifications for each Country in the world. 

I standardized the data and assigned regions for each dataset and aggregated data for each region using the region classification dataset. My goal was to use datasets that had different ways of classifying regions/locations/countries and  I was then able to standardize and visualize the data to come to understand the relationship between the three.
